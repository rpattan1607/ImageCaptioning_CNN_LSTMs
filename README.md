# ImageCaptioning with CNN LSTMs
This repository contains code for generating descriptive captions for images using a deep learning model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

## Key features and functionalities:

* Image preprocessing: Handles image resizing, normalization, and other necessary preprocessing steps.
* CNN (ResNet) architecture: Implements a ResNet model to extract deep features from the image.
* LSTM model: Utilizes an LSTM network to generate the textual caption sequence.
* Training and evaluation: Provides scripts for training the model on a labeled dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics like perplexity.
* Inference: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to generate captions for new images.
